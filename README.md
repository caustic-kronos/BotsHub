## Adding Your Own Bots

To add a new bot, drop your script into the `/src/` folder and follow these steps:
1. Name the script like `Farm-<Name>.au3`.
2. Add an include line in `BotsHub.au3`:
   ```autoit
   #include 'src/Farm-<Name>.au3'
   ```
3. Add the farm to the `$AVAILABLE_FARMS` list with its name <Name> (use | as a separator).
4. Add two lines in BotsHub - RunFarmLoop :
	```autoit
	Case '<Name>'
		Return <Name>Farm($STATUS)
	```
And that's it !
