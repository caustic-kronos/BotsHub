The 15 laws of AutoIt coding

1- Only use single quotes, unless you need to escape them			"
2- Only use tabulations for indentation								^ +
3- Don't leave spaces at the end of lines							[ \t]+$
4- Don't mix tabulations with spaces								( +\t)|(\t +)
5- Don't leave semicolons at the end of lines						;[ \t]*$
6- Use named constants instead of magic numbers as much as possible	[^a-zA-Z0-9_]([0-9]{2,})
7- Use consistent case for AutoIt keywords							^[^;\r\n]+\b\K(if|then|elseif|else|endif|func|endfunc|for|next|while|wend|do|until|return|switch|case|endswitch|continueloop|exitloop|select|endselect|true|false)\b
8- Also use consistent naming for variables							((Local|Global|Const)\s+)+\K\$[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
9- Also use consistent naming for functions							Func[ \t]+\K[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
10- Align your line comments										^[ \t]*;
11- Separate your code comments from the code with tabulations		[^\t\n]+;
12- Work on your TODOs and FIXMEs									(?i)\b(TODO|FIXME|NOTE)\b
13- Comment and describe your functions								\r\n\r\nFunc
																	^;[^~].*\r\nFunc
																	^[^;].*\r\nFunc
14- Only use While WEnd for coherence and easy comprehension		until
15- Review your logging to keep coherent and remove Out calls		(Out|Debug|Info|Notice|Warn|Error)\(
